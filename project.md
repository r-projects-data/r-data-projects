# NHM Commercial Analyst Project

## RK

Welcome to my NHM London Commercial Analyst Project.

On this page, you will find a project I have created for the NHM commercial analyst role. To create this project, I've used a variety of data sources:

- Annual Reports
- Companies House Reports
- DCMS Data
- NHM Shop Data
- Synthetic data to showcase reporting efforts

### Data Sources Overview

- **Annual Reports:** Provided a good overview of various figures, offering general context and data not accessible elsewhere.
- **Companies House Reports:** Helpful for data on different trading sectors, turnover, and operating profit, allowing for margin estimates.
- **Geographic Data:** Companies House reports also provided geographic data on international market performance, highlighting markets that might warrant attention.

*Note: I tend to switch between Companies House (CH) and Annual Report (AR) data where applicable.*

_Note2: I wish I had more time to improve the formatting and general narrative discussion around this data. However, due to time constraints I was unable to do this, but would love to talk through the project at some point. Extracting and transforming this data took a little longer than expected._

You can view the Excel pivot table by following [this link](https://datadiscoveryjournal.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/NHMProject/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B17291FE7-0F90-418E-8323-04B8954F806B%7D&file=NHM%20EXCEL%20FILE%20PIVOT%20TABLE2.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&login_hint=Rakesh%40DataDiscoveryJournal.onmicrosoft.com&ct=1725374259467&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.START.EDGEWORTH&cid=00b469e0-aeb1-433a-9a95-8162a40cafbe&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=0eafd6ef-4905-4501-a897-488487197cc8).

This information can inform online strategy, though additional data on acquisition cost per product and profit margin would be beneficial.
