# NHM Commercial Analyst Project

## Rakesh Kumar

Welcome to my NHM London Commercial Analyst Project.

On this page, you will find a project I have created for the NHM commercial analyst role. To create this project, I've used a variety of data sources:

- Annual Reports
- Companies House Reports
- DCMS Data
- NHM Shop Data
- Synthetic data to showcase reporting efforts

### Data Sources Overview

- **Annual Reports:** Provided a good overview of various figures, offering general context and data not accessible elsewhere.
- **Companies House Reports:** Helpful for data on different trading sectors, turnover, and operating profit, allowing for margin estimates.
- **Geographic Data:** Companies House reports also provided geographic data on international market performance, highlighting markets that might warrant attention.

*Note: I tend to switch between Companies House (CH) and Annual Report (AR) data where applicable.*
