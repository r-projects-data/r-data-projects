# NHM Commercial Analyst Project

## RK

Welcome to my NHM London Commercial Analyst Project.

On this page, you will find a project I have created for the NHM commercial analyst role. To create this project, I've used a variety of data sources:

- Annual Reports
- Companies House Reports
- DCMS Data
- NHM Shop Data
- Synthetic data to showcase reporting efforts

### Data Sources Overview

- **Annual Reports:** Provided a good overview of various figures, offering general context and data not accessible elsewhere.
- **Companies House Reports:** Helpful for data on different trading sectors, turnover, and operating profit, allowing for margin estimates.
- **Geographic Data:** Companies House reports also provided geographic data on international market performance, highlighting markets that might warrant attention.

*Note: I tend to switch between Companies House (CH) and Annual Report (AR) data where applicable.*

_Note2: I wish I had more time to improve the formatting and general narrative discussion around this data. However, due to time constraints I was unable to do this, but would love to talk through the project at some point. Extracting and transforming this data took a little longer than expected._

## Excel Pivot Table

This section includes data extracted from the "NHM Shop Website":

- **Pivot Table Overview:** Showcases products divided into pricing bands, using synthetic sales data to highlight total products sold per pricing band.

> **Excel File:**  
You can view the Excel pivot table by following [this link](https://datadiscoveryjournal.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/NHMProject/EecfKReQD45BgyMEuJVPgGsBy1mm4XSDJfWGoHgA3pvxqA?e=FfB60L).

This information can inform online strategy, though additional data on acquisition cost per product and profit margin would be beneficial.

## Sentiment Analysis from Trip Advisor Reviews

Reviews can have an impact on the commercial outcome of a venue like the NHM even though it is popular. I think if people are visiting just for the day, they only have so much time, and so reviews can help them decide between the NHM or another attraction in the same category. 

Therefore, to remain competitive, it's a good idea to "review the reviews"  to see what people think. Below, I conducted a sentiment analysis on the reviews by two different cohorts -- families and solo travellers. The points mentioned here can help the museum anticipate issues, and also improve the general experience people have when visiting the museum. This can then improve the overall reviews, and improve the odds of someone visiting NHM, if they're on a limited schedule.

### Family Sentiment Analysis (100 reviews):

**Positive Sentiments:**

- **Engaging Exhibits:** Families appreciate the educational and entertaining exhibits, particularly the dinosaur displays.
- **Architecture and Atmosphere:** The museum’s architecture adds to the experience, creating a memorable visit.
- **Free Entry and Value:** Free entry is highly valued, making the museum an affordable outing.
- **Child-Friendly Facilities:** Clean restrooms, seating areas, and souvenir shops are appreciated.

**Negative Sentiments:**

- **Overcrowding:** A significant issue during peak times.
- **Heat and Ventilation:** Lack of air conditioning leads to discomfort.
- **Food Prices:** The cafeteria is often criticized for being overpriced.
- **Dated Exhibits and Navigation Issues:** Some exhibits are seen as outdated, and the layout can be confusing.

### Solo Sentiment Analysis (100 reviews):

**Positive Sentiments:**

- **Diverse and Educational Exhibits:** Solo travelers appreciate the range of exhibits, especially the dinosaur displays and Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit.
- **Architecture and Ambiance:** The museum’s historic architecture enhances the visit.
- **Free Entry and Value:** The policy of free entry is a significant draw, with paid exhibits also considered worth the fee.
- **Cultural and Historical Significance:** The museum blends traditional exhibits with modern displays, resonating with visitors.

**Negative Sentiments:**

- **Overcrowding:** Particularly on weekends and during school holidays.
- **Heat and Ventilation:** Poor ventilation leads to discomfort.
- **Food Prices:** The museum’s food services are often criticized for high prices.
- **Navigation and Exhibit Layout:** The complex layout and inadequate signage make navigation challenging.
